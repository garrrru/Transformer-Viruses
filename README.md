# Transformer Viruses Project

This project aims to use transformer models to analyze genomic data related to viruses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the genomic data files.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modelss training.
- `venv/`: Contains the Python virtual environment for the project.

## Getting Started
